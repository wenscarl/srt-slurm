# Example cluster configuration (srtslurm.yaml)
# Copy this to srtslurm.yaml and customize for your cluster
# This file is gitignored to keep cluster-specific settings private

# SLURM defaults
default_account: "your-gpu-account"
default_partition: "gpu"
default_time_limit: "04:00:00"

# SLURM directive compatibility
# Set to false if your cluster doesn't support --gpus-per-node
use_gpus_per_node_directive: true  # Default: true
# Set to false if your cluster doesn't support --segment for segment-based scheduling
use_segment_sbatch_directive: true  # Default: true

# Container registry
default_container: "/shared/containers/sglang-latest.sqsh"
containers:
  sglang-latest: "/shared/containers/sglang-v0.4.sqsh"
  sglang-dev: "/shared/containers/sglang-dev.sqsh"
  sglang-fp4: "/shared/containers/sglang-fp4.sqsh"

# Model path aliases
model_paths:
  deepseek-r1: "/shared/models/deepseek/DeepSeek-R1"
  deepseek-r1-distill: "/shared/models/deepseek/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B"
  llama-3-70b: "/shared/models/meta/llama-3-70b"
  llama-3-405b: "/shared/models/meta/llama-3-405b"

# Usage:
# In your job config, you can now use:
#   model:
#     path: "deepseek-r1"         # Resolves to /shared/models/deepseek/DeepSeek-R1
#     container: "sglang-fp4"     # Resolves to /shared/containers/sglang-fp4.sqsh
#
# And you can omit SLURM fields:
#   slurm:
#     time_limit: "02:00:00"      # account and partition filled from defaults
