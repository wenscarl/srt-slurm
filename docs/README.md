# Introduction

`srtctl` is a command-line tool for running distributed LLM inference benchmarks on SLURM clusters. It replaces complex shell scripts and 50+ CLI flags with clean, declarative YAML configuration files.

## Why srtctl?

Running large language models across multiple GPUs and nodes requires orchestrating many moving parts: SLURM job scripts, container mounts, SGLang configuration, worker coordination, and benchmark execution. Traditionally, this meant maintaining brittle bash scripts with hardcoded parameters.

`srtctl` solves this by providing:

- **Declarative configuration** - Define your entire job in a single YAML file
- **Validation** - Catch configuration errors before submitting to SLURM
- **Reproducibility** - Every job saves its full configuration for later reference
- **Parameter sweeps** - Run grid searches across configurations with a single command
- **Profiling support** - Built-in torch/nsys profiling modes

## How It Works

When you run `srtctl apply -f config.yaml`, the tool:

1. Validates your configuration against the schema
2. Resolves any aliases from your cluster config (`srtslurm.yaml`)
3. Generates a SLURM batch script and SGLang configuration files
4. Submits to SLURM

Once allocated, workers launch inside containers, discover each other through ETCD and NATS, and begin serving. If you've configured a benchmark, it runs automatically against the serving endpoint and saves results to the log directory.

## Commands

| Command                                            | Description                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `srtctl apply -f <config>`                         | Submit job(s) to SLURM                  |
| `srtctl apply -f <config> --setup-script <script>` | Submit with custom setup script         |
| `srtctl apply -f <config> --tags tag1,tag2`        | Submit with tags for filtering          |
| `srtctl dry-run -f <config>`                       | Validate and preview without submitting |
| `srtctl validate -f <config>`                      | Alias for dry-run                       |
